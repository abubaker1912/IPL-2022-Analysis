# IPL-2022-Analysis
This project explores the IPL 2022 season in Jupyter Notebook. Using Python libraries, I performed data cleaning, processing, and visualization to uncover team performances, match outcomes, player statistics, and match trends that provide the deeper understanding of the season. The goal was to transform raw data into insights about the tournament.
